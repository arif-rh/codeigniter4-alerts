## Quick Start

1. Run: `> composer require tatter/alerts`
2. Load the helper: `helper('alerts');`
2. Set an alert: `alert('success', "You did it!")`
3. Add in head tag (optional): `<?= service('alerts')->css(); ?>`
4. Add after banner/menu: `<?= service('alerts')->display(); ?>`

## Features

Provides out-of-the-box user alerts for CodeIgniter 4

## Installation

Install easily via Composer to take advantage of CodeIgniter 4's autoloading capabilities
and always be up-to-date:
* `> composer require tatter/alerts`

Or, install manually by downloading the source files and adding the directory to
`app/Config/Autoload.php`.

## Configuration (optional)

The library's default behavior can be changed using its config file. Copy
bin/Alerts.php to app/Config/Alerts.php and follow the instructions in the
comments. If no config file is found the library will use its defaults.

## Usage

If installed correctly CodeIgniter 4 will detect and autoload the library, service, helper,
and config. Initialize the helper if you want the convenience wrapper function:
`helper('tatter\alerts');`

Then use the helper function `alert($class, $text)` to set an alert for the user's next
view. Use class methods `$alerts->css()` and `$alerts->display()` to retrieve the styling
and HTML for the alerts.

## Styles

By default alerts will be displayed with classes for Bootstrap. Styles can be changed
to other toolkits (or you may use your own) by altering the settings in the config file.
